# Complete Guide to Email Regex

Welcome to my Complete Guide to Email Regex. In this guide, I will be explaining the components of my email regex and how they work. I will also be providing examples of how to use the regex and how to test it. I will also be providing a link to a regex tester that I used to test my regex. I will also be providing a link to my GitHub profile. So lets dive in and explore the fascinating world of regex.

## Summary

In this guide, I will be explaining the components of my email regex and how they work. I will also be providing examples of how to use the regex and how to test it. I will also be providing a link to a regex tester that I used to test my regex. I will also be providing a link to my GitHub profile. So lets dive in and explore the fascinating world of regex.

## Regex Components
Regular expressions consist of various components. These components are used to create a pattern that can be used to match character combinations in strings. The components that I will be discussing in this guide are anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, the OR operator, flags, and character escapes. I will be explaining what each component does and how it works. I will also be providing examples of how to use each component. I will also be providing a link to a regex tester that I used to test my regex. I will also be providing a link to my GitHub profile. So lets dive in and explore the fascinating world of regex.
### Anchors
Anchors (`^` and `$`) are used to assert the position of a pattern within the input text.
The `^` anchor matches the start of a line, while the `$` anchor matches the end of a line.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found. The quantifiers that I will be discussing in this guide are `*`, `+`, `?`, `{n}`, `{n,}`, `{n,m}`.

### Grouping Constructs
Grouping constructs delineate the subexpressions of a regular expression and capture the substrings of an input string. The grouping constructs that I will be discussing in this guide are `()`, `(?:)`, `(?=)`, `(?!)`.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions are used to match a single character out of a set of characters. The bracket expressions that I will be discussing in this guide are `[]`, `[^]`.

### Character Classes
Character classes are used to match a single character out of a set of characters. The character classes that I will be discussing in this guide are `\d`, `\D`, `\w`, `\W`, `\s`, `\S`, `.`.

### The OR Operator
The OR operator (`|`) is used to match either the expression before or after the operator. The OR operator that I will be discussing in this guide is `|`.

### Flags
Flags are used to perform different types of searches. The flags that I will be discussing in this guide are `g`, `i`, `m`, `s`, `u`, `y`.

### Character Escapes
Character escapes are used to match a character that has special meaning in regex. The character escapes that I will be discussing in this guide are `\`, `\0`, `\n`, `\f`, `\r`, `\t`, `\v`, `\cX`, `\xhh`, `\uhhhh`, `\u{hhhh}`.
